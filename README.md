# tseries-deconvolution

The notebook Deconvolution_of_Michael_coronavirus_data-Mixtures.ipynb is better run from Google Colab where files.load can be used to load the .csv files from the data/ directory here, and fitted curves are stored in the content/ directory in Colab. I downloaded them and stored them in fits/ directory here
